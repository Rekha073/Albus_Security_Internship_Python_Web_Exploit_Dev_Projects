# Albus_Security_Internship_Python_Web_Exploit_Dev_Projects
This repository contains two tools- Keylogger and API-detector which is written in Python.

*Overview*
## Keylogger Tool
A stealthy keylogger program that records all keystrokes made on a computer system. It's designed to run undetected and capture information for security analysis.
### API-Detector Tools
This tool is designed to detect various APIs by analyzing web traffic patterns. It helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities and points of exploitation.

### Features:
-Keylogger Detection: Scans the system for known keylogging signatures and behaviors.
-API Activity Monitoring: Tracks and analyzes API calls to detect unusual or unauthorized activity.
-Real-time Alerts: Provides immediate notifications upon detecting suspicious activities.
-Comprehensive Reports: Generates detailed logs and reports for further analysis.
-User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for both technical and non-technical users.
-Customizable Settings: Allows users to configure detection parameters and thresholds.

#### Installation and Usage
 To install and set up the Keylogger and API Detection Tool, follow these steps:_
  -Clone the repository i.e git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger-api-detection-tool.git
  -Navigate the project directory i.e cd keylogger-api-detection-tool
  -Install the required dependencies i.e pip install -r requirements.txt
 Usage
 To use the tool, run the following command:
  -python main.py
  Command Line Options
   '--scan': Initiates a full system scan for keyloggers and API activity.
   '--report': Generates a report based on the latest scan results.
   '--config': Opens the configuration file for customization. 
    Example: python main.py --scan

 **Important Note:*
 -Always ensure that you have permissions to use a kelylogger and API detector in system you intend to monitor.
 -Misuse of keyloggers can result in Legal Consequences.
 -Use this knowledge responsibly and ethically.
